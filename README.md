<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Sliding-Block-Puzzle project is about solving a puzzle game that consists of a confined area with 8 different pieces, where the goal is to move one specific piece, labeled "Z", to the right-hand side of the puzzle. To achieve this goal, all the pieces need to be moved in a specific order. The program will find the shortest solution for the puzzle, where all pieces can move in any direction (left/right or up/down). The program takes a data file as an input from the command line, which contains the necessary information about the puzzle. The output of the program will be a sequence of moves that provide the shortest solutions.
