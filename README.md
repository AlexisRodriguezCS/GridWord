## About The Project

Welcome to GridWorld! In this world, every person is represented by a number and lives in a square-shaped district, unless they are dead. The world itself is an RxC grid, where each district is identified by its row and column, denoted by r∈{0..R-1} and c∈{0..C-1}. Sometimes, we may refer to a district as Dr,c.

The people in GridWorld are uniquely identified by an integer ID, similar to a social security number. The person IDs start from zero, and each living person resides in a single district. When a world is created, it has no people in it, and every district is a wasteland with no population. However, there are several operations that can be performed on the world once it's created.

The initial configuration of a world is determined by two things: the number of rows (R) and columns (C) in the grid. Once a world is created, it is possible to perform various operations such as adding people to the world or moving them between districts. GridWorld is an exciting and dynamic place, and by performing different operations, we can observe how the world and its inhabitants evolve over time.

Here's an online demo of the project hosted on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@Alexisrz/Grid-World) for you to try out.
